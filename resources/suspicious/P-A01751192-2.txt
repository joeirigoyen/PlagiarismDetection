In this paper, we discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used in political-military modeling, simulation, and wargaming of conflicts with nations having weapons of mass destruction and other high-end capabilities involving space, cyberspace, and long-range precision weapons. Plagiarism has become a serious problem in education, and several plagiarism detection systems have been developed for dealing with this problem. This study provides an empirical evaluation of eight plagiarism detection systems for student essays. We present a categorical hierarchy of the most common types of plagiarism that are encountered in student texts. In this article, an intelligent scheme for structural damage detection and localization is introduced by implementing a hybrid method using the Hilbertâ€“Huang transform and the wavelet transform. First, the second derivatives of the Discrete Laplacian are computed on Hilbert spectrum parameters at each frequency coordinate, and then, in order to highlight the influence of damage on signals, the data are rescaled and weighted with respect to the variance to adjust the differences in amplitude at different scales. Afterwards, the anti-symmetric extension is applied to deal with the boundary distortion phenomenon.
