Sentiment analysis is a method to identify these emotions and determine whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mood of the people, and this was evident on social networks. This paper analyses data imported from the Twitter API for the healthcare sector, emphasizing sub-domains, such as vaccines, post-COVID-19 health issues and healthcare service providers.  In this article, we apply four widely used data mining classifiers, namely K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine, and naive Bayes, to analyze the sentiment of the tweets. This work presents a study on the feelings of the population in Mexico during one of the waves that produced the most contagion and deaths in this country. The main objective of this research is to analyze machine learning models for classifying the sentiments of people and analyzing the direction of polarity by considering the views of the majority of people. These common user publications are a source of information to measure the population's opinion on social phenomena. Our results show that support vector machine demonstrates better outcomes compared to other algorithms, showing an improvement of 3.53% on dataset with two-class data and 7.41% on dataset with three-class data in accuracy rate compared to other algorithms.
