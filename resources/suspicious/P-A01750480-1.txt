The vaccination campaign started December 27th 2020 in Italy, together with most countries in the European Union. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed peopleâ€™s lives and society. This work employs a transformer-based BERT model for Malayalam sentiment analysis. Social media platforms can offer relevant information about how citizens have experienced and perceived the availability of vaccines and the start of the vaccination campaign. This study aims to use machine learning methods to extract sentiments and topics relating to COVID-19 vaccination from Twitter. Hence in this study, the microblogging website Twitter is used to gather more than 450,000 English language tweets from 12th March 2022 to 22nd January 2022, consisting of keywords related to working from home. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is a pre-trained model that has been used for various natural language processing tasks. A state-of-the-art pre-processing technique is used to convert all emojis into text, duplicate tweets, URLs, remove username tags, retweets, hashtags etc. and then the text is converted to lowercase. Thus, the number of tweets is reduced to 358,823. The efficacy of BERT in analyzing the sentiments latent in Malayalam texts has been studied by comparing the performance of BERT with various machine learning models as well as deep learning models.
