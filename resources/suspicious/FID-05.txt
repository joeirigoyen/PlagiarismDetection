Fraudulent activities continue to be a major concern for businesses due to their dynamic and unpredictable nature. Fraudsters exploit advancements in technology to bypass security measures, resulting in significant financial losses. Data mining techniques, such as analyzing unusual transactions, can help identify fraudulent activities. This paper aims to benchmark multiple machine learning methods such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest and support vector machines (SVM), while the deep learning methods such as autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNN), restricted boltzmann machine (RBM) and deep belief networks (DBN). The datasets which will be used are the European (EU) Australian and German dataset. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Cost of failure are the 3-evaluation metrics that would be used.
