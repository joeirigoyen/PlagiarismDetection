Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to analyze and learn from complex data. In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in addressing some of the most challenging problems in the medical field. Due to the scarcity of trained human resources, they used an existent huge database. The database consists of 1,238 records of respiratory sounds of patients and 133 records of volunteers. A deep learning algorithm based on sleep sounds recorded by a noncontact voice recorder served as a tool for apneic event detection. The algorithm exhibited robust performance that could also interpret the severity of the disease identified. The trained model can diagnose bronchial asthma. The results showed us that despite these challenges, deep learning holds tremendous potential to revolutionize the way we approach medical diagnosis, treatment, and research. Further studies are warranted.
