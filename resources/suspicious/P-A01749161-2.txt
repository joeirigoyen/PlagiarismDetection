Plagiarism is any identical or lightly-altered use of one’s own or someone else’s work. Text plagiarism detection systems are widely available. The ease of accessing articles online has led to an increase in plagiarism and modification of wording in articles. The issue of article plagiarism has become increasingly important due to research paper plagiarism that have been frequently proclaimed. Previous studies on plagiarism detection have been conducted mainly by using vectors, statistics and matrices methods.This study proposes a prototype plagiarism detection system that uses Chinese word segmentation and SQL intersection operation to address the issue of reduced accuracy caused by superfluous words and modified wording in plagiarized articles. This study’s results show higher efficiency and more precision of the plagiarism detection method proposed than the commercial plagiarism-detection software available on the market.
