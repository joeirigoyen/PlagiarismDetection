This work conducts a study on the use of digital technologies in the education process, since we can no longer disassociate the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the teaching-learning process, using artificial intelligence (AI). Considering that we are facing a pandemic, such as that of COVID-19, we must be prepared to participate in an active, targeted and efficient way, making the student have the best experience and learning possible. AI is an area of computer science that studies the phenomenon of intelligence and that through it instruments can be built to support human intelligence, through mechanisms or software. The use of AI in education has been significant, especially in distance education as it can be worked with interactions between the teacher and student and directly in the learning environment with games, quiz, and others.
