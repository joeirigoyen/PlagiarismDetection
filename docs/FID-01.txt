This paper describes the implementation of FromTo-CLIR, which consists of four parts: query translator, meta-search engine, front-end and back-end processors, and a robust hybrid machine translator, a Web-based natural language interface for cross-language information retrieval. In the second set we use the MSNN to detect only a particular type of target In the third set we test a novel scenario: We train the MSNN to recognize a particular type of target using very few examples. A detection rate of 86% with a reasonable number of false alarms was achieved in the first set of experiments and a detection rate of close to 100% with very few false alarms was achieved in the second and third sets of experiments.
