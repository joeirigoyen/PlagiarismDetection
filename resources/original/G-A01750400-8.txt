With the extensive availability of technological systems all over the world and the increasing diffusion of
information and documents by users, especially for the Arabic population, the development of semantic
plagiarism detection systems has become essential due to its importance for protecting the rights of
authors. Developing such a system that can covers the content of all Arabic documents using ontology
as a semantic resource would be a complex and time-consuming task and would require intelligent nat-
ural language-processing capabilities.
In the context of Arabic plagiarism detection systems using an Arabic ontology and permitting these
systems to support semantic representation to more efficiently verify the originality of the research
and meet the needs of researchers, this paper presents a novel approach for addressing plagiarism named
Multi-agents Indexing System. The proposed system is composed of three phases: (1) natural language
processing phase, (2) indexing phase and (3) evaluation phase.
Our experimentations are based on the training dataset released for the AraPlagDet curpus. The
obtained results indicated that the proposed system has improved the performance of plagiarism detec-
tion in Arabic documents with semantic indexing and mutli-agents system.
