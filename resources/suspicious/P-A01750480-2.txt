The outbreak of the pandemic, caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has affected the daily activities of people across the globe. By the end of 2022, more than 100 million people were infected with COVID-19 in the United States, and the cumulative death rate in rural areas was much higher than in urban areas. During COVID-19 outbreak and the successive lockdowns, Twitter was heavily used and the number of tweets regarding COVID-19 increased tremendously. The second stage of our study involved the design, development, and evaluation of 56 classification models. Stemming and lemmatization techniques were used for vocabulary normalization. The subject matter of the tweets varied more between stances than between genders, suggesting that there is no significant difference between the contents of tweets posted by females and males. As the pandemic spread, people used social media platforms to express their opinions and concerns about COVID-19-related topics. The prime focus of the presented ABCML-SA model is to recognize the sentiments expressed in tweets made upon COVID-19. Vectorization was based on CountVectorizer and TF-IDF methodologies. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Na√Øve Bayes, and XGBoost were deployed as learning algorithms. Based on this analysis, it can be observed that most tweets exhibit a neutral stance, while the number of tweets in favor of vaccination is greater than the number of tweets opposing vaccination, with the distribution varying across time in response to specific events.
