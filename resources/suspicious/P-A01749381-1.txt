Therefore, algorithm technologies of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, which are typical machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as agricultural technology, personal authentication, wireless network, game, biometric recognition, and image recognition, are being improved and expanded in this paper. In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm to train neural network, called Class-Constrained Extreme Learning Machine ((CELM)-E-2), which is based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In (CELM)-E-2, we use class information to constrain different parts of connection weights between input layer and hidden layer using Extreme Learning Machine Auto Encoder (ELM-AE). In pattern recognition, the goal is to identify patterns and regularities from data with minimal intervention. Finding the patterns and regularities is done using machine learning algorithms. In other words, pattern recognition is the engineering application, while machine learning origin back in computer science. Machine learning algorithms map the input data to the output which these algorithms have two main steps: the training step and the inference step. In recent years, machine learning algorithms are continuously being used and expanded in various fields, such as facial recognition, signal processing, personal authentication, and stock prediction. In particular, various algorithms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, are continuously being improved. Among these algorithms, the expansion of deep learning is rapidly changing.
