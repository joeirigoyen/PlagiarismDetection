In this chapter we provide an overview on some of the main issues in machine learning.  This is the first study to fill this gap by describing new dimensions of data quality for supervised machine learning applications.  With the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing devices, more quantum algorithms are being developed with the aim at exploiting the capacity of the hardware for machine learning applications.
