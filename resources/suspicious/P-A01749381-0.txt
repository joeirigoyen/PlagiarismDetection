Image-based machine learning models can be used to make the sorting and grading of agricultural products more efficient. In many regions, implementing such systems can be difficult due to the lack of centralization and automation of postharvest supply chains. Stakeholders are often too small to specialize in machine learning, and large training data sets are unavailable. We propose a machine learning procedure for images based on pre-trained Vision Transformers. In general, Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms exhibit black-box behavior. Users input text and output are provided with no explanation of how the results are obtained. In order to increase understanding and trust, users value transparent processing which may explain derived results and enable understanding of the underlying routines. This is especially problematic for machine learning: given its statistical nature, code with subtle errors may run and produce results that look plausible but are meaningless. This can vitiate scientific results. We report on Ariadne: applying a static framework, WALA, to machine learning code that uses TensorFlow. We have created static analysis for Python, a type system for tracking tensors-Tensorflow's core data structures-and a data flow analysis to track their usage. The visible NLP (VNLP) pipeline design is then applied to a text similarity application to demonstrate the utility and advantages of a visible and transparent NLP pipeline in supporting users to understand and justify both the process and results. We also report feedback on our framework from a modern languages expert.
