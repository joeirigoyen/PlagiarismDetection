Sentence plagiarism detection is a significant concern, particularly in the realm of scientific texts. Plagiarism detection has been a significant issue with important consequences for the scientific and industrial communities. Plagiarism detection tools have been created to help identify instances of plagiarism. Sentence similarity measures, which use similarity metrics to compare and evaluate similarities between two distinct sentences, are one potential solution for supporting plagiarism detection. The Semantic Word Error Rate (SWER) has been proposed and experimentally evaluated as an innovative similarity measure for detecting plagiarism in sentences. SWER utilizes a sophisticated approach based on latent semantic analysis. SWER has the potential to significantly enhance the ability to detect plagiarism in sentences.These measures have a wide range of applications, including machine translation, paraphrase identification, speech recognition, question-answering, and text summarization.
