This abstract discusses the use of machine learning techniques for traffic prediction, in light of the increasing popularity of GPS car navigation. Recently, GPS car navigation became popular enough for a significant number of drivers in any large city to be able to potentially send their current GPS positions and velocities to a central traffic-managing server in real time. Machine learning methods can be used to analyze the data and generate accurate predictions of traffic conditions. This abstract highlights the potential of machine learning for traffic prediction, emphasizing its significance for optimizing traffic management in large cities.
