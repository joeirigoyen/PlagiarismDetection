What’s the difference between a house cat and a lion? The number of humans it kills each year. If you weren’t expecting that answer, then buckle up.Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have an increasingly pervasive presence in all fields of science due to their ability to find patterns, model dynamic systems, and make predictions of complex processes. This review aims at providing the researchers in the mineral processing area with structured knowledge about the applications of machine learning algorithms to the leaching process. We’re ranking the most dangerous animals based on how many human attacks or deaths per year they cause
