Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing systems which can be used in order to enhance almost every technology-enabled service, products, and industrial applications. This article discusses the possibility and the benefit of creating a user-friendly general-purpose pattern recognition that can be played around by anyone using software as a service. A subfield of artificial intelligence and computer science is named machine learning which focuses on using data and algorithms to simulate learning process of machines and enhance the accuracy of the systems. Natural Language Processing (NLP) in combination with Machine Learning techniques plays an important role in the field of automatic text analysis Motivated by the successful use of NLP in solving text classification problems in the area of e-Participation and inspired by our prior work in the field of polymorphic shellcode detection we gave classical NLP-processes a trial in the special case of malicious code analysis. The existence of cloud computing enables data scientists to create their machine learning models with the benefits of cloud computing which are very low cost, high performance, and high availability. Machine learning systems can be applied to the cutting forces and cutting tool wear prediction in CNC machine tools in order to increase cutting tool life during machining operations. This opens a new opportunity of allowing students and other people to utilize powerful machines for daily use with the help of appropriate cloud service. On the other hand, machine learning is usually perfect for recognizing patterns in our daily life.
