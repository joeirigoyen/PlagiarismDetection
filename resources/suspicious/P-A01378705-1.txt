This paper explores the use of machine learning models to simulate photonic dynamics. Two distinct strategies for modeling excited state properties are tested in this work. The first strategy is to treat each state separately in a kernel ridge regression model and all states together in a multiclass neural network. The second strategy is to instead encode the state as input into the model, which is tested with both models. Numerical evidence suggests that using the state as input yields the best performance. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for machine learning models to improve our understanding of photonic dynamics and pave the way for more efficient and accurate simulations of photonic systems.
