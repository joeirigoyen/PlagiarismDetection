The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) have promoted teaching reform while improving peopleâ€™s lives. Under the new teaching environment, the position of physical education (PE) teaching in the teaching work has become increasingly prominent. At present, there are some problems in the PE teaching mode of most colleges and universities, such as poor teaching environment, unstable teaching data, and lack of technical support for the teaching system. This also leads to the low quality of PE teaching and unsatisfactory teaching results. In this paper, IoT and AI are combined to study the application mode of innovative practical teaching in college PE. This paper first constructs a physical education teaching system based on the Internet of Things, then summarizes the necessity of artificial intelligence technology participating in the reform of physical education classroom teaching, and gives a specific teaching application model. Finally, based on the golden sine algorithm-optimization neural network, the application model of college physical education in this paper is evaluated. Through experiments and investigations, the new teaching mode improves the teaching efficiency by 14.7%, improves the teaching quality, and provides reference for the next development of IoT and AI in teaching.
