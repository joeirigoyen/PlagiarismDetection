Source identification is the primary task of detection of plagiarism. Find possible sources of plagiarism in a questionable document. Modern approaches often rely on classical models of information detection, such as the probability model or vector space model, to find sources of plagiarism. Nevertheless, the purpose of accessing the source document is to find source documents containing the plagiarized parts of the suspected document, rather than classifying the relevant documents for the entire document. To model the "partial correspondence" between documents, this work proposes a matching convolutional neural network (PMCNN) for resource retrieval. Specifically, PMCNN leverages a sequential convolutional neural network to extract plagiarism patterns from contiguous pieces of text. Experimental results in the PAN 2013 and PAN 2014 plagiarism detection corpus have shown that PMCNN significantly improves source detection performance, improving other cutting-edge document models.
