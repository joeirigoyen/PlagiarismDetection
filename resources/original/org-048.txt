There is still a certain deviation between the current artificial intelligence technology and the traditional learning mode, which makes it unable to be effectively applied in teaching and learning. Therefore, an effective method needs to be proposed to use functions to predict data. Function calculation can not only solve the complex problems of data calculation process but also make the data evenly distributed to take full advantage of the capabilities of each system. In this experiment, we mainly use the control function. After substituting the data into the control function, the function will automatically classify the data. In this paper, according to the actual situation of physical education in colleges and universities, from the two aspects of artificial intelligence and comprehensive learning algorithm, to build a system which can collect and analyze the past achievements of college students' physical education performance simulation can effectively help the design of physical education curriculum. According to the distribution of experimental data, a specific conclusion can be drawn; that is, the test model we choose can calculate and measure the physical fitness level of students, but there are big differences. In contrast, our experimental method using the ensemble computing model can not only predict and analyze the physical fitness level of college students but also reduce errors and shorten the time required for the experiment.
