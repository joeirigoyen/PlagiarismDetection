Natural Language Processing (NLP) together with Machine Learning techniques plays an important r√¥le in automated text analysing. Motivated by success of NLP in text classification problems in e-Participation and inspiring fron our prior work in polymorphic shellcode detection we used NLP-processes for malicious code analysis. Malicious programs are based on machine language, ranging from manually crafted assembly code to high level languages targetting web-based attacks. We argued that well-known NLP analysis processes can modify and apply to malware analysing domain. As a proof-of-concept we apply our framework to examples by Metasploit.
