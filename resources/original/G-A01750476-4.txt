Plagiarism detection is gaining increasing importance due to requirements for integrity in education. In this paper, we have developed a new integrated approach for extrinsic plagiarism detection. The proposed approach is based on four well-known models namely Bag of Words (BOW), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Stylometry and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed approach works by capturing usage patterns of the most common words (MCW) from books of 25 authors. Stylistic features for each author were harnessed in the method by adjusting the LSA weighting technique. The adjusted LSA method was trained in a novel manner using the leave-one-out-cross-validation technique and compared with the traditional LSA method. The results have shown that the enhanced weighting method of the adjusted LSA outperforms the traditional LSA method.
