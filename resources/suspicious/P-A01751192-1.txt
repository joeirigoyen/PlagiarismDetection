In this paper, the authors review extant natural language processing models in the context of undergraduate mechanical engineering education. These models have advanced to a stage where it has become increasingly more difficult to discern computer vs. human-produced material, and as a result, have understandably raised questions about their impact on academic integrity. This paper describes the procedure for developing a new airfoil family. This airfoil family applies to heavy-duty, industrial, and aero-derivative gas turbine compressors ranging from subsonic to transonic flow regimes. The airfoil family is generated by filling a database with optimized airfoil geometries. This database is structured in six dimensions, called design space parameters, including inlet Mach number, inlet flow angle, outlet flow angle, axial velocity density ratio, maximum thickness to chord ratio, and solidity. Reliable prediction of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rates is a significant element of planning and implementation of sustainable solid waste management strategies. In this study, the multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) is applied to verify the prediction of annual generation rates of domestic, commercial and construction and demolition (C&D) wastes from the year 1997 to 2016 in Askar Landfill site in the Kingdom of Bahrain.
