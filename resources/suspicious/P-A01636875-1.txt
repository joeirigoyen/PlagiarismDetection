The increasing use of the Internet has led to a rise in cyber-attacks, making the cyber security landscape increasingly challenging. This survey report describes key literature surveys on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods for network analysis of intrusion detection and provides a brief tutorial description of each ML/DL method. Papers representing each method were indexed, read, and summarized based on their temporal or thermal correlations. As data is crucial for ML/DL techniques, this report also discusses commonly used network datasets and challenges associated with using ML/DL for cybersecurity. Finally, the report offers suggestions for future research directions in the field.
