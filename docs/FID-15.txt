Results from experiments show that a combined approach generally performs better with less effort compared to active learning and machine teaching.  Therefore, there is a pressing need for better understanding of adversarial attacks against ML models, in order to secure them against such malicious attacks.  More recently there has been an increased emphasis on Probabilistic ILP and the related fields of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and Structured Prediction.
