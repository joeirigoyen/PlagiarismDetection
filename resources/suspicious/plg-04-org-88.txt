Proper methods are needed to identify plagiarism in documents. Plagiarism detection is usually based on the similarity of documents. This paper evaluates the validity of the distributed word representation to determine document similarity. This paper proposes a plagiarism detection method based on the local maximum value of the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) with the weight determined by the distributed representation. The proposed method and two other simple methods based on the simple length of LCS and the maximum unweighted value of LCS are applied to the competition data for plagiarism detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method is useful in applications where complex plagiarism detection is required.
