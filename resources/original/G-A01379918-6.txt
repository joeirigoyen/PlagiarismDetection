With the development and application of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence, big data, and other information technologies, sports fitness has ushered in new development opportunities. Intelligent sports detection has emerged as the times require. This paper takes intelligent physical fitness as the research object, explores the application of digital and intelligent image processing in physical fitness, and provides a theoretical reference for popularizing and implementing intelligent physical fitness in life. Firstly, the treadmill is an example to study the current situation of fitness equipment, especially the intelligent digital treadmill, and the future development trend of fitness equipment. Secondly, the upper and lower computer control scheme is proposed. The upper computer control scheme is selected, and the industrial computer is analyzed. The motion model of the main control motor and the calculation model of the heart rate control scheme and calorie consumption are established. Finally, the software and algorithm design of the control system are summarized, and necessary debugging, experiment, and analysis are carried out. The results show that: (1) the treadmill industrial control system can correctly receive the data sent by the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) and express it in the form of images, which completely matches the asynchronous communication data format. (2) The ultrasonic distance detection experiment proves that the distance precision between the operating platform and the human body is extremely high, and its digital intelligent treadmill can meet human perception and corresponding control requirements well. (3) The heart rate pulse of the human body can be collected based on digital technology. The waveform displayed in the image is relatively stable and complete.
