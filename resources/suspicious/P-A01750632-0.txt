Plagiarism is a serious problem in education, research, publishing and other felds. Automatic plagiarism detection systems are crucial for ensuring the integrity and genuineness of intellectual work. There are diferent types of plagiarism, such as copyâ€“paste, obfuscation and translation. In particular, obfuscated text is one of the hardest types of plagiarism to detect. In this paper, we propose an automatic plagiarism detection system for obfuscated text based on a support vector machine classifer that exploits a set of lexical, syntactic and semantic features. LSTM can always achieve the best prediction performance in the prediction. Taking advantage of the ML technique, we then propose a heuristic based method and a reinforcement learning (RL) based method relying on ML workload prediction to generate the VM migration plan in the datacenter. We also compared the performance of our system to the performances of other systems that participated in the PAN competitions. The obtained results show that our system had the best performance in terms of the F-measure on the PAN 2012 and on the PAN@FIRE2015 obfuscated sub-corpora, the experimental results show that the workload prediction helps reduce the SLO violation rate and/or the number of migrations, which improves the load balance performance in a datacenter. Also, the RL based VM migration method outperforms the heuristic based method in a heavily loaded system but does not show obvious advantages in a lightly loaded system.
