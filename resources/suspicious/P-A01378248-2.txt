In this paper we study the Syntagmatic, Paradigmatic and Transfer relations Complex Predicates (CPs) enter, within a Machine Translation (MT) approach. Recognition of objects is a particularly demanding problem. We introduce an algorithm that combines local nonlinear invariant features with high discrimination capabilities and statistical classification. This tracking system can be very useful in controlling a robot at a remote site. Experimental results show that the method is effective and efficient. It is shown that the algorithm performs well, is robust to occlusion and outliers, and that it degrades nicely as the segmentation problems increase.
