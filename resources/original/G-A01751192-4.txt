This paper describes the procedure for developing a new airfoil family. This airfoil family applies to heavy-duty, industrial, and aero-derivative gas turbine compressors ranging from subsonic to transonic flow regimes. The airfoil family is generated by filling a database with optimized airfoil geometries. This database is structured in six dimensions, called design space parameters, including inlet Mach number, inlet flow angle, outlet flow angle, axial velocity density ratio, maximum thickness to chord ratio, and solidity. This six-dimensional space includes all compressor blades used in stationary gas turbine compressors. Each set of these design space parameters is related to an optimal geometry produced by the optimization system. The optimization system includes a parametrized airfoil generator, an accurate, fast blade-to-blade flow solver, and an evolutionary optimization algorithm. Airfoils of different stationary gas turbine compressor types are investigated to cover the required design space. Four hundred thirty airfoils, denoted as reference airfoils, are used to define design space borders. Comparing the newly optimized airfoils with reference airfoils revealed superior performance throughout the entire design space. They incorporate these optimized airfoils into a surrogate model, resulting in a fast, optimized airfoil generator (airfoil family). The transonic rotor of the existing multistage compressor has been redesigned according to the developed airfoil family. 3D computational fluid dynamics showed a 2% efficiency improvement for optimized blade row over the original design. Integrating this airfoil family and a streamline curvature code as part of a compressor design system is the main application of this advanced airfoil family.
