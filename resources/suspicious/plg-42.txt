The rise of extreme machine learning as a revolutionary learning algorithm has emphasized it in hidden solitary flow networks. Kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) has proven itself in several applications where the service map functions of hidden nodes are hidden from users. Conventional KELM algorithms only involve separate kernel layers, simulating shallow learning architectures for function transformations. The trend of transferring basic learning models to deep learning architectures opens up new perspectives for machine learning domains. This document tests a kernel deep learning method on traditional foundational architectures. Rising arc-cosine nuclei are better able to simulate the dominant deep-layer framework. Unlike other kernels, such as linear, polynomial, and Gaussian kernels, arc-cos kernels are inherently recursive and can express multi-layer computations in learning models. This paper examines the possibility of building a new deep kernel engine using extreme machine learning and a multi-layered arc-cos kernel. This framework outperforms traditional KELM and deep support vector machines in terms of accuracy and training time.
