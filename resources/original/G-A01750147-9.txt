This demonstration presents a chatbot desinged to automate students service in the enrolment process at the University of Alicante (UA). A chatbot in the instant messaging service Telegram, with human lenguage tecnologies and artificial inteligence, has been implemented. The main obstacle has been to off er this chatbot in the two oficial languages of Comunidad Valenciana, so automatic translation has been used as a middleware component. This chatbot offers numerous advantages to UA for the enrollment process, however we emphasize it represents a reinforcement of the student service, in terms of human cost reduction and assistance 24/7. This technology generates a trusted environment between UA and its potential students.
