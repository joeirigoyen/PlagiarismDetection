Artificial intelligence has recently gained popularity across different medical fields to aid in the detection of diseases based on pathology samples or medical imaging findings. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key assessment tool for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). 
The capability of these new technologies to extract tiny interactions of different items has been appreciated especially in treatment complex diseases. They are capable to analyze not only enormous amounts of data (big data) in an extremely short time but also these processes of analyses are easily improved by machine itself (machine learning). Examples of Aapplication in several medical disciplines and itinerary for Electronic Health Records adoption in the Czech health care are listed.
