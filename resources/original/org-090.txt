Plagiarism is any identical or lightly-altered use of one’s own or someone else’s work. Text plagiarism detection systems are widely available. Even though image plagiarism detection systems exists, flowchart based plagiarism detection systems are rarely implemented. In the proposed flow chart plagiarism detection system, flowcharts are compared by comparing both the shape, orientation as well as text. This approach creates graph from the flowchart, hence is capable to detect the plagiarism with same shaped objects even though the orientation of the graph is changed. Accuracy of the method is tested with flowcharts of different shape and orientation.
