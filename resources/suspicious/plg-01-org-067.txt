In this paper, we introduce YOLO, a new approach for the problem of object detection. In prior work, object detection makes use classifiers to perform detection. Here,  frame object detection is framed as a regression problem so as to infer spatially separatable bounded boxes and associating class probabilities. One neural network predicts bounded box and classes probabilities from images in one evaluation. Our unifying architecture is extreme fast. In comparison to  state-of-the-art detecting systems, YOLO makes more localize error but it is less likely to a predict false positive on a given background.
