Typologies are a precise and efficient way to draw the boundaries of a certain phenomenon, identify its different manifestations, and, in short, go into its characterization in depth. Also, typologies constitute the basis of many corpus
annotation processes, which have their own effects on the typologies themselves: The annotation process tests the adequacy of the typology for the analysis of the data, and allows for the identification of new types and the revision of 
the existing ones.
