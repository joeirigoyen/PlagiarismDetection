Exploitation has largely focused on single look, single modality platform collections exploited by a variety of classification algorithms over the last several decades. But multi look, multi modality exploitation is the evolving paradigm for threat classification given the evolution and cost of near term unmanned vehicle system sensor platforms. This paper presents an overview of machine learning algorithms that have previously been applied to automatic target recognition, discusses the evolution of target recognition to the 2010 paradigm of multi look, multi modality valid target identification, and explores how advanced machine learning algorithms can be applied to address the exploitation problems of the next decade.
