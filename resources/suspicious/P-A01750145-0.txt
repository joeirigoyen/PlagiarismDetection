Sound is a form of energy that is created by vibrations that travel through a medium such as air, water, or solids. These vibrations cause changes in pressure in the medium, which our ears can detect and interpret as sound. Scientists use complex methods to investigate about heart sounds to detect anomalies. With an emphasis on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) methods developed over the last five years, an in-depth systematic review and an analysis of existing deep learning methods were performed in the present study. Thanks to this studies many lives have been saved. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art shear wave imaging techniques are extremely sensitive to patient and sonographer motion, and generally suffer from low frame rates, are limited to high-end ultrasound hardware due to high-power requirements, and.
