In the increasingly complex world of modern management deci sion making, the availability of sophisticated, but at the same time user-friendly, decision-support systems has become crucial. Business simulation and corporate models are already widely used as management planning tools and relatively user-friendly software is commercially available. However, one area that has been neglected is the interpretation of the highly complex sim ulation results, which often can only be done by experts. How ever, an expert system can be used to analyze the simulation results, draw inferences and issue recommendations, making the advantages of simulation fully available to non-expert users.
