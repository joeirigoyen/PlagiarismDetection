This paper describes an approach for object-based image retrieval based on classes of objects is images. In this approach, contours of objects are extracted from images and are represented under a scheme which satisfies scale, rotation, and translation invariance. Classifier learning techniques are used to classify objects in images into different classes. Image similarity calculation is performed based on class information of objects. Experimental results show that the method is effective and efficient.
