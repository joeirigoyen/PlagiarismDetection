Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing systems which can be used in order to enhance almost every technology-enabled service, products, and industrial applications. A subfield of artificial intelligence and computer science is named machine learning which focuses on using data and algorithms to simulate learning process of machines and enhance the accuracy of the systems. Machine learning systems can be applied to the cutting forces and cutting tool wear prediction in CNC machine tools in order to increase cutting tool life during machining operations. Optimized machining parameters of CNC machining operations can be obtained by using the advanced machine learning systems in order to increase efficiency during part manufacturing processes. Moreover, surface quality of machined components can be predicted and improved using advanced machine learning systems to improve the quality of machined parts. In order to analyze and minimize power usage during CNC machining operations, machine learning is applied to prediction techniques of energy consumption of CNC machine tools. In this paper, applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems in CNC machine tools is reviewed and future research works are also recommended to present an overview of current research on machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches in CNC machining processes. As a result, the research filed can be moved forward by reviewing and analysing recent achievements in published papers to offer innovative concepts and approaches in applications of artificial Intelligence and machine learning in CNC machine tools.
