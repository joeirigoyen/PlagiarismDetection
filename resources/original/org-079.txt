Our Canvas course also includes instructions on how to use Turnitin, along with our terms and conditions for students use of the service. We originally did not monitor students Turnitin submissions 
very closely, but after a while, I, as the Libraries Turnitin Service administrator, began noticing some issues with instructors signing up for the service in order to check their students papers. This is not what we intended the 
Libraries Turnitin Service for, so we implemented two changes to the process.Often I get an apologetic reply from a student saying that they were checking a paper for a friend; in these cases, I encourage them to have their friend 
sign up for their own account.
