Typologies coming from discourse analysis classify paraphrases according to the reformulation mechanisms or communicative intention behind them, but without focusing on the linguistic nature of paraphrases themselves, which, in contrast,
is our main focus of interest. Our Canvas course also includes instructions on how to use Turnitin, along with our terms and conditions for students use of the service. We originally did not monitor students Turnitin submissions very 
closely, but after a while, I, as the Libraries Turnitin Service administrator, began noticing some issues with instructors signing up for the service in order to check their students papers. The conditioning factors that incentive 
plagiarism among target students were identified by presenting situations that could promote cheating attitudes. This is not what we intended the Libraries Turnitin Service for, so we implemented two changes to the process.
