Belief merging has received much attention from the research community with a large range of applications in Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence. Artificial intelligence has improved the accuracy and capability of model simulations, but often at the expense of a rational understanding of the systems involved. The lack of transparency in black box models, artificial intelligence based ones among them, can potentially affect the trust in science driven policy making. In this paper, we represent a new belief merging approach for prioritized belief bases. The main idea of this method is to use two operators, namely connective strong operator and averagely increasing operator to merge possibilistic belief bases. By this way, the proposed method allows to keep more useful beliefs, which may be lost in other methods because of drowning effect. The logical properties of merging result are also analyzed and discussed. The use of artificial intelligence methodologies in a variety of real-world applications has been around for some time. However, the application of such methodologies to thermal science and engineering is relatively new, but is receiving ever-increasing attention in the published literature since the mid 1990s.
