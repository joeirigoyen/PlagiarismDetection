This research aims to validate the effectiveness of a machine learning model composed of three classifiers: decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machines. Through the design of a workflow, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. First, we execute a network attack, and then monitoring, processing, storage, visualization, and data transfer tools are implemented to create the most realistic environment possible and obtain more accurate predictions.
