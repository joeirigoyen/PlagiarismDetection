Cheating in examinations destroys the principles of fairness and justice in evaluation. Cheating detection is of great practical significance. Traditional cheating detection methods have many disadvantages, such as difficult to detect covert equipment cheating, multi-source cheating, difficult to distinguish plagiarists from plagiarists, difficult to distinguish plagiarists from victims, or plagiarism from coincidences. In this paper, the concept of knowledge point mastery Index is introduced to measure students’ mastery of a certain knowledge point, and a test method of cheating based on improved cognitive diagnostic model is proposed. This method calculates the weight of each knowledge point in every examination question through linear regression and EM algorithm according to students’ historical learning behavior, and then calculates students’ mastering degree of knowledge point based on historical answers. Then calculate the mastering degree of knowledge point based on the examination results. Finally, we compare the mastering degree of knowledge point based on the examination results and the historical answers to detect students’ cheating situation. The experiments show that the precision and recall rate of this method are significantly higher than those of the method based on the false-same rate, the method based on the false-same rate and the right-same rate and the method based on the Person-Fit index.
