In recent years, due to the high availability of electronic documents through the Web, thWe compare the performance accuracy of a slot-based antenna and a Vivaldi antenna for breast tumor detection using machine learning (ML) algorithms jointly with microwave imaging (MWI) processing. MWI is known for having low resolution. Therefore, we here study the conjoint use of ML and MWI, in order to enable accurate detection of breast tumors and evaluate how the probing antenna affects the overall system performance.
We have developed a software named BAAD, which uses ML algorithms for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression. Methods: We constructed an algorithm by combining a support vector machine (SVM) to classify and a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to reduce concerned variables.
