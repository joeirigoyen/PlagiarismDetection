 Examples include techniques for improving the sensitivity of Advanced Laser Interferometer GW Observatory and Advanced Virgo GW searches, methods for fast measurements of the astrophysical parameters of GW sources, and algorithms for reduction and characterization of non-astrophysical detector noise.  In this paper, there was a literature review of scientific journals published in the years 2010 and 2011, with the aim of identifying the main machine learning techniques utilized for text mining.  We also provide a comparative study involving other commonly used datasets, and report on the competitiveness of sparse machine learning compared to state-of-the-art methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
