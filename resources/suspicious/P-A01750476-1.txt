 Also, we propose that Plagiarism detection is one of the areas where Paraphrase Identification can be effectively implemented. Plagiarism detection is gaining increasing importance due to requirements for integrity in education.  These methods formulate learning and estimation problems in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of functions defined on the data domain, expanded in terms of a kernel.
