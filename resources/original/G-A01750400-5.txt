Plagiarism refers to the appropriation of someone elseâ€™s ideas and expression. Its ubiquity makes it necessary to
counter it, and invites the development of commercial systems to do so. In this document we introduce Docode
5, a system for plagiarism detection that can perform analyses on the World Wide Web and on user-defined
collections, and can be used as a decision support system. Our contribution in this document is to present this
system in all its range of components, from the algorithms used in it to the user interfaces, and the issues with
deployment on a commercial scale at an algorithmic and architectural level. We ran performance tests on the
plagiarism detection algorithm showing an acceptable performance from an academic and commercial point
of view, and load tests on the deployed system, showing that we can benefit from a distributed deployment.
With this, we conclude we can adapt algorithms made for small-scale plagiarism detection to a commercial-scale
system.
