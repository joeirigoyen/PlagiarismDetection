Source retrieval for plagiarism detection retrieves documents that may be the sources of
plagiarism for a suspicious document while minimizing the retrieval costs. Compared with
traditional information retrieval, queries from the same suspicious document retain their
contextual relations and are no longer isolated from each other. The correlation of queries
leads to the aggregation of search results; the documents retrieved by different queries
may be relevant or the same. However, previous studies have failed to devote sufficient
attention to the aggregation of search results in source retrieval. In this paper, the task of
source retrieval is formalized into a framework of learning to rank, and a Ranking Logis-
tical Regression Model is utilized to implement the framework. Furthermore, addressing
the aggregation of search results, we propose the Source Retrieval Model Focused on Ag-
gregation for plagiarism detection. We evaluate various aspects of the proposed model on
the PAN 2013 and the PAN 2014 Plagiarism Source Retrieval Corpus. With respect to estab-
lished baselines, the experimental results indicate that the Source Retrieval Model Focused
on Aggregation yields statistically significantly improved performance of source retrieval
with equal or lower cost effectiveness.
