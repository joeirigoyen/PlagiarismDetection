Due to the rapid growth of documents and manuscripts in various languages all over the world,
plagiarism detection has become a challenging task, especially for cross lingual cases. Because of
this issue, in today's plagiarism detection systems, a candidate retrieval process is developed as
the first step, in order to reduce the set of documents for comparison to a reasonable number. The
performance of the second step of plagiarism detection, which is devoted to a detailed analysis of
the candidates is tightly dependent on the candidate retrieval phase. Regarding its high im-
portance, the present study focuses on the candidate retrieval task and aims to extract the
minimal set of highly potential source documents, accurately. The paper proposes a fusion of
concept-based and keyword-based retrieval models for this purpose. A dynamic interpolation
factor is used in the proposed scheme in order to combine the results of conceptual and bag-of-
words models. The effectiveness of the proposed model for cross language candidate retrieval is
also compared with state-of-the-art models over German-English and Spanish-English language
partitions. The results show that the proposed candidate retrieval model outperforms the state-of-
the-art models and can be considered as a proper choice to be embedded in cross-language
plagiarism detection systems.
