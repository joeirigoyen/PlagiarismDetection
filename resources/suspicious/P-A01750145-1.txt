Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with over 17 million deaths each year. Most deaths are caused by heart disease. Chronic heart failure (CHF) affects over 26 million of people worldwide. Our proposal is an efficient machine learning model that helps to identify heart diseases. Heartbeat sound classification is a challenging problem in feature extraction and heart sound segmentation. This is a hard task because research studies include the lack of sufficient data, poor representations of sound features, weakly labelled data, noisy datasets, unbalanced datasets.
