The paper attempts to analyze current situation in plagiarism detection and to analyze existing methods and tools for checking the plagiarized programming code and natural language (particularly Slovak) text. Then, we describe our approach to plagiarism detection for two particular but important cases: texts in formal programming language and texts in natural language (Slovak). We describe method and tools that evaluate plagiarized programming code and plagiarized Slovak text. Our method and tool proposal has an ambition to improve some of the known weaknesses. We aim at implementing an effective, widely usable tool with more precise results. We are in the process of setting it in our Faculty environment.
