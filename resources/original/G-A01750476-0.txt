One of the most modern problems that computer science try to resolve is the plagiarism, in this article we present a new approach for automatic plagiarism detection in world of mail service. Our system is based on the n-gram character for the representation of the texts and tfidf as weighting to calculate the importance of term in the corpus, we use also a combination between the machine learning methods as a way to detect if a document is plagiarized or not, we use pan 09 corpus for the construction and evaluation of the prediction model then we simulate a meta-heuristic method based on genetic algorithms with a variations of parameters to know if it can improve the results. The main objective of our work is to protect intellectual property and improve the efficiency of plagiarism detection system.
