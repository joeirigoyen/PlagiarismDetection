Machine learning has emerged as a popular and powerful method for solving problems in astrophysics. We review the use of machine learning techniques in the analysis of ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detector data. Examples include techniques to increase the sensitivity of the Advanced Laser Interferometer GW Observatory and Advanced GW Virgo searches, methods for rapid measurements of astrophysical parameters of GW sources, and algorithms to reduce and identify noise in non-astrophysical detectors. The application shows how machine learning techniques can be used to improve the science of current and future GW detectors.
