Machine learning is evolved from a collection of powerful techniques in AI areas and has been extensively used in data mining, which allows the system to learn the useful structural patterns and models from training data. Machine learning algorithms can be basically classified into four categories: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning. In this chapter, widely-used machine learning algorithms are introduced. Each algorithm is briefly explained with some examples.
