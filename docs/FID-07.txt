Source retrieval is the primary task of plagiarism detection. It searches the documents that may be the sources of plagiarism to a suspicious document. The state-of-the-art approaches usually rely on the classical information retrieval models, such as the probability model or vector space model, to get the plagiarism sources. However, the goal of source retrieval is to obtain the source documents that contain the plagiarism parts of the suspicious document, rather than to rank the documents relevant to the whole suspicious document. To model the “partial matching” between documents, this paper proposes a Partial Matching Convolution Neural Network (PMCNN) for source retrieval. In detail, PMCNN exploits a sequential convolution neural network to extract the plagiarism patterns of contiguous text segments. The experimental results on PAN 2013 and PAN 2014 plagiarism source retrieval corpus show that PMCNN boosts the performance of source retrieval significantly, outperforming other state-of-the-art document models.
