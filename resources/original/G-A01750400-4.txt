Cross-language (CL) plagiarism detection aims at detecting plagiarised fragments of text among docu-
ments in different languages. The main research question of this work is on whether knowledge graph
representations and continuous space representations can complement to each other and improve the
state-of-the-art performance in CL plagiarism detection methods. In this sense, we propose and evaluate
hybrid models to assess the semantic similarity of two segments of text in different languages. The pro-
posed hybrid models combine knowledge graph representations with continuous space representations
aiming at exploiting their complementarity in capturing different aspects of cross-lingual similarity. We
also present the continuous word alignment-based similarity analysis, a new model to estimate simi-
larity between text fragments. We compare the aforementioned approaches with several state-of-the-art
models in the task of CL plagiarism detection and study their performance in detecting different length
and obfuscation types of plagiarism cases. We conduct experiments over Spanish-English and German-
English datasets. Experimental results show that continuous representations allow the continuous word
alignment-based similarity analysis model to obtain competitive results and the knowledge-based docu-
ment similarity model to outperform the state-of-the-art in CL plagiarism detection.
