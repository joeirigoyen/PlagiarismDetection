The phenomenon of scientific burglary has seen a significant increase recently due to the technological development in software. Therefore, many types of research have been developed to address this phenomenon. However, detecting lexical, syntactic, and semantic text plagiarism remains to be a challenge. Thus, in this study, we have computed and recorded all the features that reflect different types of text similarities in a new database. The created database is proposed for intelligent learning to solve text plagiarism detection problems. Using the created database, a reliable plagiarism detection system is also proposed, which depends on intelligent deep learning. Different approaches to deep learning, such as convolution and recurrent neural network architectures, were considered during the construction of this system. A comparative study was implemented to evaluate the proposed intelligent system on the two benchmark datasets: PAN 2013 and PAN 2014 of the PAN Workshop series. The experimental results showed that the proposed system based on long short-term memory (LSTM) achieved the first rank compared to up-to-date ranking systems.
