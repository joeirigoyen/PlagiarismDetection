The field of Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning (HITL-ML) has emerged as a new area of research, which aims to develop interaction between humans and machine learning algorithms. This paper presents two approaches, Iterative Machine Teaching (iMT) and Active Learning (AL), and analyzes how they can be integrated into the learning loop. iMT is a Machine Teaching approach, where a machine acts as a teacher to transfer knowledge to a machine learning model. The focus is on obtaining the optimal training set for a given algorithm and target model. On the other hand, AL is a supervised learning approach that uses human input to analyze unlabeled data, achieving higher accuracy with less data and training. Our proposal to incorporate iMT and AL into the machine learning loop is to use iMT as a technique to obtain the “Minimum Viable Data (MVD)” for training a learning model, that is, a dataset that allows us to increase speed and reduce complexity in the learning process by allowing to build early prototypes. Several experiments were conducted to test the feasibility of this approach, showing that the algorithms trained with teachers converge faster than those trained in a conventional way, and AL helps to avoid getting stuck and to keep improving after the first few iterations. Overall, these two approaches are complementary and correspond to different stages in the learning process, and their integration offers promising results for HITL-ML.
