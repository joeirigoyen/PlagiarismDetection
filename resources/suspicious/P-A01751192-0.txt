In this article, we propose that new architectural design practices might be based on machine learning approaches to better leverage data-rich environments and workflows. Through reference to recent architectural research, we describe how the application of machine learning can occur throughout the design and fabrication process, to develop varied relations between design, performance and learning. The family of machine learning methods is not somehow inherently bad or dangerous, nor does implementing them signal any intent to cause harm. Nevertheless, the machine learning assemblage produces a targeting gaze whose algorithms obfuscate the legality of its judgments, and whose iterations threaten to create both specific injustices and broader states of exception. Given the urgent need to provide some kind of balance before machine learning becomes embedded everywhere, this article proposes peopleâ€™s councils as a way to contest machinic judgments and reassert openness and discourse. Structural health diagnosis and prognosis is the goal of structural health monitoring. Vibration-based structural health monitoring methodology has been extensively investigated.
