In this paper, a line-feature-based approach for model based recognition using a four-dimensional Hausdorff distance is proposed. This new approach reduces the problem of finding the rotation, scaling, and translation transformations between a model and an image to the problem of finding a single translation minimizing the Hausdorff distance between two sets of points in a four-dimensional space. The implementation of the proposed algorithm can be naturally extended to higher dimensional spaces to efficiently find correspondences between n-dimensional patterns. The method performance and sensitivity to segmentation problems are quantitatively characterized using an experimental protocol with simulated data. It is shown that the algorithm performs well, is robust to occlusion and outliers, and that it degrades nicely as the segmentation problems increase. Experiments with real images are also presented.
